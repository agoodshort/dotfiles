# My chezmoi dotfiles

I will groom a little bit more this README later, for now here is the command I wanted to save somewhere.

```
nvim --headless -c 'autocmd User PackerComplete quitall' -c 'PackerSync'
```

```
brew bundle dump --force --describe
brew bundle
```

## To-Do

- [ ] Review Fugitive usage
