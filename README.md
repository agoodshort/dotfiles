# My chezmoi dotfiles

I will groom a little bit more this README later, for now here is the command I wanted to save somewhere.

```
nvim --headless -c 'autocmd User PackerComplete quitall' -c 'PackerSync'
```

```
brew bundle dump --force --describe
brew bundle
```

```
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## To-Do

- [ ] Change keymaps for git view in neotree to match the ones from lazygit
- [ ] Review Fugitive usage
- [ ] Review steps to install zsh
- [ ] Review bashrc and profile (use only profile)
- [ ] Review required `brew casks/formula` to run the zsh or bash properly
